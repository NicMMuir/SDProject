[09:21, 9/22/2020] Imraan Sultan: Logistic regression model back button is complete 

Busy with Predict multi student Lin regression now, not sure of I'll be able to figure this one out, but gonna give it a try 👍🏼
[09:54, 9/22/2020] Imraan Sultan: Is it "Logistic" regression or "Linear" regression ?😂
[10:36, 9/22/2020] Nic: Logistic I think 😂
[11:40, 9/22/2020] Leko: This will have to be deleted 😂
[11:40, 9/22/2020] Soni: 😡
[12:57, 9/22/2020] Imraan Sultan: Where do I find the " pd.read_csv(file) "
[13:17, 9/22/2020] Nasiem: What are you busy with?
[13:19, 9/22/2020] Imraan Sultan: I'm adding another function in views.py
[13:19, 9/22/2020] Imraan Sultan: For the PredictMultiStudentLGR Page
[13:20, 9/22/2020] Imraan Sultan: So I'm not sure if I need to change read_csv to something different.
[13:20, 9/22/2020] Nasiem: We don't
[13:20, 9/22/2020] Imraan Sultan: Oh ok 😂
[13:21, 9/22/2020] Imraan Sultan: So the LGR model will take a csv file aswell
[13:21, 9/22/2020] Imraan Sultan: ?
[13:22, 9/22/2020] Nasiem: Chat on dc?
[13:22, 9/22/2020] Imraan Sultan: 👌🏻
[15:04, 9/22/2020] Nasiem: For one of our user stories, the bar graph one 
I think we should change it for answering the 3rd research question
[11:33, 9/23/2020] Nic: Ok so our coverage has dropped hectically so ima start working on tests for the stuff we have implemented
[11:34, 9/23/2020] Imraan Sultan: Do u know what to test?
[11:36, 9/23/2020] Nic: Things in the views.py that aren’t covered 😂
[11:36, 9/23/2020] Imraan Sultan: 👌🏼😂
[11:37, 9/23/2020] Imraan Sultan: I added the multistudentLGR page if that's any benefit to you 💁🏻‍♂️
[11:57, 9/23/2020] Nic: @Nasiem @Imraan Sultan  what does this bit of code do ? Just get the possible predictions ?
[11:58, 9/23/2020] Imraan Sultan: ...@Nasiem  ? 🤷🏻‍♂️😂
[12:03, 9/23/2020] Nasiem: Who coded this?
[12:03, 9/23/2020] Nasiem: Yes I think our coverage dropped only because of the charts
[12:04, 9/23/2020] Nic: Don’t stress i cheap skated my way through a test for this 😂😂😂😂
[12:05, 9/23/2020] Nic: It was under the chart shit but I sorted it out 😎
[12:06, 9/23/2020] Imraan Sultan: 👌🏻
[12:14, 9/23/2020] Nasiem: So it increased our coverage? 👀
[12:15, 9/23/2020] Nic: Don’t you even worry about it 💁🏻‍♂️
[12:15, 9/23/2020] Nic: 😂
[12:16, 9/23/2020] Nasiem: Sure 😂😂

[18:44, 9/24/2020] Soni: All of my other friends are playing tonight 😂
[18:50, 9/24/2020] Imraan Sultan: I've been playing on my phone and the other day I got voted off first for no reason at all, two games in a row 😤 I was soooo pissed 🤣
[18:52, 9/24/2020] Soni: It's cause you're suspicious

[09:17, 9/28/2020] Nic: Greetings all. Can we have a meeting today to see what’s been completed etc?
[10:15, 9/28/2020] Soni: Is the next sprint due tomorrow?
[10:34, 9/28/2020] Nic: Ya
[10:34, 9/28/2020] Nic: So we need to get everything done, meeting today at 2 possibly ?
[10:34, 9/28/2020] Nic: To see what we need to Finnish ?
[10:39, 9/28/2020] Soni: We have a pc test so it might have to be later than that
[10:40, 9/28/2020] Soni: I got the dates wrong so I'm behind on user stories but will have them done in time ofc
[10:49, 9/28/2020] Nic: Ok 🤙🏼 Maby 5 then ?
[10:51, 9/28/2020] Nic: We are gona be working late tonight it looks 😂  the only issue I am seeing is that the bar chart and pie chart aren’t displaying due to the mobile responsiveness stuff
[10:52, 9/28/2020] Leko: Are there 4 charts total?
[10:52, 9/28/2020] Nic: Ya there should be but only 2 confusion matrecies are displaying
[10:52, 9/28/2020] Leko: Okay will fix after test
[10:53, 9/28/2020] Nic: Cool 👌🏼 goodluck on the test lads
[10:53, 9/28/2020] Leko: Thx
[15:01, 9/28/2020] Soni: Might need to have the meeting in the evening based on how things are looking
[15:06, 9/28/2020] Nic: Works for me

[15:06, 9/28/2020] Nic: I’ll be on all day
[17:22, 9/28/2020] Nic: Msg when you guys are ready
[17:54, 9/28/2020] Soni: What is the logistic regression back button supposed to do?
[18:05, 9/28/2020] Imraan Sultan: So from the "predict student svc" page you can go to the "predict student lgr" page, but there's no option to go back to the "p_s_svc" page from the "p_s_lgr" page.
[18:05, 9/28/2020] Imraan Sultan: So that's what the buttons suppose to do
[18:05, 9/28/2020] Imraan Sultan: Hope I make sense
[18:06, 9/28/2020] Nic: When are we meeting lads ?
[18:06, 9/28/2020] Imraan Sultan: I think Anthony said 8...

[18:06, 9/28/2020] Imraan Sultan: I'm easy
[18:08, 9/28/2020] Nic: Ya works for me
[18:11, 9/28/2020] Leko: Maybe, since I've just started my go of the test
