            to identify the current trajectory of their academic performance.

            <br>
            <br>
            The following section explores a further set of possible questions that the <b>Student Predictor</b>
            can be used to answer.

        <ol style = "font-size: 1.5em;">
            <li>Which subjects do students struggle most with?
                
                <br>
                <ul>
                    For the first research question we will be exploring our results by taking a number of factors into account.
                    Firstly we need to normalize the data, since we have to factor the amount of people taking the course against the results of people who
                    have already completed it.

                    We can further expand on how to explore the data here by implementing a form of Bayesian Analysis. In particular, using the formula:
                    P(A|B) = (P(B|A)P(A))/P(B),
 
                    which gives us the probability of a student passing given a condition. For example, "What is the probability a student will pass
                    given their MATHS 2 marks are average or high?" This will help us assess which subjects students will struggle with the most.
                </ul>
                    From our results we have found that in both years Mathematics is the subject that students struggle the most with.
                    Which is reflected in the statistics, found on the statistics page. Mathematics has consistently lower averages and lower
                    pass rates compared to other subjects. The reason behind this is probably due to the difficulty of Mathematics at a higher level than
                    students are used to coming out of school. It is interesting to see that students who excel at Mathematics tend to have higher averages
                    across all subjects.
                </ul>
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Which features contribute the least to a student's success?
           
                <br>
                <ul>
                    To determine which features a student will struggle with the most, we intend to apply either Information Gain Ranking or Principal
                    Component Analysis.

                    We also intend to use this diagram provided by our client/lecturer to guide our process.
                    <div class = "container"><img style="max-width: 90%; height: auto;" src = "/static/img/researchimage.png"></div>
                </ul>
                    
                    From the results found on the statistics page, The subject mathematics contributes the least to a students success.
                    This is seen by the disparity in year of study mark and that of the two subject marks. In most cases, having a high COMS mark
                    correlated more with higher yearly averages than having a high MATH mark did. The factors explained in the diagram are avenues
                    we wish to explore in the future, as we know they definitely have an impact on the pass rates of students. For example in a year of
                    high stress which was 2016's Fees must Fall pandemic, we saw extreme drop rates in pass rates across all students. We would need a
                    different set of data to explore this, however.
                
                </ul>
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Which is more useful to student success, first or second year?              
                <br>
                <ul>
                    We intend to solve this by first proposing a hypothesis, either saying first year is more useful or second year is more useful.
                    By means of confusion matrices we will then explore if our initial hypothesis was correct or not and in doing so derive a 
                    solution to the question of which year is more important.
                </ul>
                 <br>
                 <ul>
                    Our proposed hypothesis is that first year is more useful to predict student's success than second year. This hypothesis
                    is substantiated by the confusion matrices. The diagonal of the confusion matrix shows the correct predictions for low and medium risks.
                    for first year we get a total of 76 students along the diagonals and for 2nd year we get 70 students over a consistent sample size.
                    This shows us that the first year predictions are more accurate and therefore more significant to the prediction contribution.
